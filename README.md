# RPG Project

This repository is an initial idea of a project that will list all features of the DnD 5.0 Edition API.  The project is separated into many endpoints to make requests with a graphical interface made in ReactJs.

The project provides for the listing of monsters, spells, features, classes and more. An integration with roll20 is also possible to create a spell token, where the system takes into account how many spells the player can spend depending on his level.

The project will also have a longin system, to be able to save the current status of the player.

Used Stack so far:
 - [X] ReactJs
 - [X] Express
 - [X] Material UI
